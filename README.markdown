# PetaTest #

<h2 class="tagline">A tiny unit testing thing for your peace of mind</h2>

PetaTest is tiny but powerful, embeddable, dependency free [Unit Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) framework for .NET and Mono.

## Features at a Glance

* Tiny - a single C# file you can easily add to any project
* Dependency Free - no other assemblies (other than what's in the GAC) or test runners required - it's all self contained
* Fast - practically no overhead over the time of the tests themselves
* Parameterized Tests - drive test inputs with attributes, or generate them in code
* Active Tests - using attributes, mark any test as active and all others will be ignored - great during development and debugging when you just want to run one test
* Assertions - most of the usual suspects, easily extensible
* Stack Trace - as you'd expect
* Source Code Extracts - see the exact line of code that threw the exception in the report
* Setup and TearDown - for test cases and test fixtures
* Text Output - writes directly to console output, or
* HTML Output - can generate a nice self-contained single file HTML report
* Sort of compatible with NUnit's assertion model (but not constraints)
