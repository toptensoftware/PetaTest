# PetaTest - Support

PetaTest is provided as is, with no warranty or support.  If you find it useful then great, if not then so be it.  Unfortunately I'm unable to provide direct support, however:

1. If you have a question about how it works or how to use it, you should be able to find the answer in the source code - it's all there and it really is quite simple.
2. If you find a bug, please log it in github.  I'll review those from time to time and fix what I can.  Even better send a pull request with a fix.
3. If you have a suggestion, log it in github - or implement it yourself and send a pull request.
4. For anything else, you could try asking on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) or [contact me](http://www.toptensoftware.com/contact) and I might get back to you.
